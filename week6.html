        Final Project Idea</h2>
        <p style="margin-right: 36px;">
        After the feedback for Brief 1, I proceeded to convert my paper prototype to code. Initially, I planned to separate the words think and feel into 2 documents, before combining them into one. However, after looking at others' examples, I realised it made more sense to combine them into one main document. I was rather overwhelmed looking at the examples I found as there were so many new functions I had never seen before all combined into a singular processing document. Not knowing where exactly to begin, I asked in the class' Milestone excel sheet for help. Karen Ann suggested “count[ing] the words by finding the 'length' of [the] string variable. E.g. if [I] have myString="Hello World";  the myString.length will be 2, then [I] can use this to change [my] colour either by accessing a colour from a list or changing the r, g, b values.” 
        <br><br>
        I referenced <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/char/#:~:text=char()%20converts%20numbers%20to,single-character%20string%20is%20returned" target="_blank">the p5.js website</a> to try to understand what a string variable was, and used ChatGPT and Copilot for one that was applicable to my idea. While I have not adjusted the position of each word, the code worked to a certain extent where I could make each word disappear each time I clicked it. However, the background would not change according to the majority text, likely due to a  missing command in my current code.

                In class, we went through someone's question on how to create columns for our SKO. I could not really keep up in class so I asked my friend Brian for help afterwards. The most straightforward manner to do it was through HTML, but I also wanted to learn how to do it through p5.js. Thus, he made use of ChatGPT to generate a basic nested loop structure and explained how to execute it in the context of p5.js. If I did not try using loops in this grid structure trial, I would still be extremely confused on what exactly a loop is. If I had not used a loop, I might still be manually adjusting the position of my images.
