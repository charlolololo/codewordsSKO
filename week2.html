    <h1>Week 2</h1> 

    <p style="margin-top: -12px;">
        Today's class heavily focused on traditional conceptualising. In the first half of class, we learnt more about<br>
        the context and history for vintage games. In the second half, we did a revision on HTML and CSS, as well as<br>
        publishing our first repository.

        For our group experiment, my team (Jarrett, Karen, Tisha, Nicole, and I) decided to work with Pacman for our<br>
        practice paper prototype. This whole concept of paper prototyping was still very foreign to us, so we chose a<br>
        game that was relatively simple. I did not know how we could “animate” the pellets disappearing when Pacman<br>
        eats them. However, one of our group members came up with the idea of cutting slits in the paper so that we<br>
        could move the strips of paper when players interact with the prototype. Due to a time crunch, we also stuck<br>
        some of the ghosts onto the strips, to imitate them chasing Pacman. However, we realised quickly that this<br>
        meant they would be very limited in movement, and players could only move Pacman specific direction.
        <br><br>
        Looking at other groups' works, it might be better to not limit elements on the paper prototype to slits in<br>
        the paper. The other groups put their elements on individual paper strips, to allow for easier movement.<br>
        I might implement that idea into my final paper prototype, instead of the slits that my group used.
