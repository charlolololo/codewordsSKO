    <h1>Week 2</h1> 

    <p style="margin-top: -12px;">
        Today's class heavily focused on traditional conceptualising. In the first half of class, we learnt more about<br>
        the context and history for vintage games. In the second half, we did a revision on HTML and CSS, as well as<br>
        publishing our first repository.

        Vintage Games
    </h2>

    <p style="margin-top: -6px;">
        For our group experiment, my team (Jarrett, Karen, Tisha, Nicole, and I) decided to work with Pacman for our<br>
        practice paper prototype. This whole concept of paper prototyping was still very foreign to us, so we chose a<br>
        game that was relatively simple. I did not know how we could “animate” the pellets disappearing when Pacman<br>
        eats them. However, one of our group members came up with the idea of cutting slits in the paper so that we<br>
        could move the strips of paper when players interact with the prototype. Due to a time crunch, we also stuck<br>
        some of the ghosts onto the strips, to imitate them chasing Pacman. However, we realised quickly that this<br>
        meant they would be very limited in movement, and players could only move Pacman specific direction.
        <br><br>
        Looking at other groups' works, it might be better to not limit elements on the paper prototype to slits in<br>
        the paper. The other groups put their elements on individual paper strips, to allow for easier movement.<br>
        I might implement that idea into my final paper prototype, instead of the slits that my group used.

        1st Github Repository
    </h2>

        <p style="max-width: 30vw;">
            After doing a quick revision on last week's HTML and CSS tags,<br>
            we learnt how to upload everything onto our first Github Repository. 
            <br><br>
            After learning HTML and CSS for the past 2 weeks, learning a new<br>
            language to code for the “README.md” was rather intimidating, as I<br>
            had barely wrapped my head around HTML and CSS. After a while,<br>
            I realised it was quite similar to HTML. Seeing the links between two<br>
            languages ended up helping me understand them better individually.
            <br><br>
            I was still quite confused by what exactly a Github repository was,<br>
            even after class. After asking my close coding friend, Brian,<br>
            I understood Github as being similar to Google Drive, to upload<br>
            files, but code isntead of normal files. This studio has pushed<br>
            me to ask for help outside of class, and not just from my lecturers.<br>
            Asking from various coders helps me to understand the different<br>
            methods one can code, and I found it extremely helpful to ask for<br>
            different perspectives in class, as well as from friends outside.
