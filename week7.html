    Redoing Brief 2
    </h2>

    <p>
    After creating our drafts from Week 6, we presented our ideas to our peers in class as well as Andy.
    <br><br>
    Here is the feedback I received from my peers:<br>
    <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
            - Maybe the difference in the 2 outcomes can be more obvious, such as through making use of text size etc.<br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
            - Could possibly make use of different fonts to show the connotations of “THINK” and “FEEL”<br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
            - The contrast between the font sizes could be more extreme, to create a stronger contrast between each answer<br>
            <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
            - Give the audience some instructions to let them know they need to eliminate a certain category of words</p>
    </p>

        However, after consulting with Andy, I realised I would have to come up with a whole new idea. The idea I previously proposed might have been good enough for Brief 1 and as an initial paper prototype, but it did not evoke as much anxiety as I would like it to have, according to Andy. He suggested that I could create a dropdown box, to mimic a form of sorts, and have viewers pick the right answer. Each time they chose something, it could trigger a glitch of sorts. This was rather stressful as I was unsure if I would be able to think of a new concept and finish coding it well in 6 weeks. Despite this, I still decided to change my idea as I agree that my idea was not overwhelming enough, and ultimately would not be able to evoke the emotions<br>I want to in my viewers.

        SKO
    </h2>
    <p>
        We also presented our SKO ideas in class with the rest of the class. I proposed two ideas: a claw machine, and catching circles.
    </p>

        <figcaption class="caption">My SKO sketches</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>

    <div class="element1">
        <div>
        
        <p>
            For my first idea, I was inspired by a <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/656b40630000000009025797?source=webshare&xhsshare=pc_web&xsec_token=ABzdvfwQfdSXXY6GFOm-wlxZzNzhGPSgkHN56RT68qZFA&xsec_source=pc_share" target="_blank">Chinese Designer</a> on Xiaohongshu. In this code, the audience would have to use their hands to grab the characters in the claw machine manually.
My plan for this idea is to use the claw as the cursor, and viewers would have to grab one of the 12 different 3D characters to access each week's reflection.



My second idea is based off the portfolio I made for my internship applications using Readymag. Viewers would have to chase after the individual elements on the screen, similar to my Readymag website, in order to access each page.

After sharing with the class, I decided to go with the first idea as Karen Ann was enthusiastic about the idea of a claw machine. I personally also felt that it was a stronger original idea than the second one, as I have never done this before. After some research, I saw people using Three.JS and React to create 3D websites, thus I might explore that in my own time to see how I can combine it with the languages and libraries I have learn so far.
<br><br>
After class, I downloaded the React library with my friend Brian's help. I was confused about the whole concept of libraries,<br>
still being under the impression that React was a completely different language from P5, even though both of them fall under<br>
the category of Javascript. I have no been able to explore React with 3D elements yet, as I have not created any for my SKO.
