    <h1>Week 5</h1> 
    <p>
        This was a presentation week where we shared all our paper prototypes with each other.
    </p>

        Sharing of Brief 1</h2>
    
    <p>
        When sharing my paper prototype, the main challenge I faced was explaining my<br>
        concept while moving my paper prototype. I could have improved this by explaining<br>
        clearly in the beginning, but I did not realise that my peers were confused until we<br>
        started carrying out the activity itself.
        <br><br>
        For the design itself I might have to include some written instructions if I wish to<br>
        continue moving forward with this idea.

            SKO Ideation</h2>

    <div class="element1">
    <p>
        This class was rather short as most was spent sharing our work and documenting it.<br>
        We ended off class with a short Crazy Eight activity for our SKO's layout.
        <br><br>
        My ideas for my SKO were rather vague as I am not sure what exactly I can code.<br>
        I did not want to give overtly ambitious ideas that I could not end up coding,<br>
        though I knew I should not be limiting myself during the Crazy Eight stage.<br>
        This led to some rather boring ideas which I do not think I will end up using.
