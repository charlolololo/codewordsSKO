# codewordsSKO

When I first began this studio, I was worried about how I would manage coding to create aesthetically pleasing designs even though I have never been good at technology. However, it has proven to be a really fruitful learning experience. As I learn more about coding, it has opened horizons in design that I never thought I would be able to achieve, and I cannot wait to expand on my own personal creative coding projects.

Admittedly, I spent too much time building my foundations in coding and using them on my major project, that I did not achieve as much with my SKO as I wanted. Although I could not fully implement my claw machine within the project timeframe. I hope to continue working on my idea of a 3D claw machine animation in my own time, to push my coding abilities and achieve my ideas as a designer. 

Going into this semester knowing nothing, I am still amazed that I have been able to code two websites from scratch. This was a studio that really pushed me to my limits as a designer, yet I am so thankful that I chose it. Understanding coding will help tremendously in any design project, especially in web design. Now, I know what to take note of when designing websites, to make them not only aesthetically-pleasing, but efficient and user-friendly as well.
