        Coding has always been an area that I did my best to avoid, as I have always been weak in areas<br>
        related to technology. However, this year I made sure to choose studios heavily surrounding new<br>
        technology to challenge myself. Thus, I knew I had to choose this in Semester 2 when I saw the<br>
        introduction and website from Codewords 2020.

        What is creative coding?
    </h2>

    <p style="margin-top: -6px;">
        Initially, I had no idea what to expect as my only impression of creative coding came from the<br>
        Codewords 2020 website. I tried searching for examples on my own but did not even know what<br>
        kind of key words to use. The examples of creative coding given by Andy really helped to set a better<br>
        perspective of what exactly we could create with coding. While the whole concept still seems rather<br>
        abstract to me, I now have more ideas on what one can create through coding.<br><br>
        
        One of the creatives introduced that left an impression on me was Winnie Soon from Hong Kong.<br>
        As a Singaporean-Chinese, designs with Chinese characters often evoke a sense of nostalgia in me<br>
        as it reminds me of home. Upon a closer look, I realised that I had chanced upon her work last year in ACCA!

        Concrete Poetry
    </h2>
    
    <p style="margin-top: -12px;">
        After exploring the basics of creative coding we were introduced to the idea of concrete poetry.<br>
        Using Mark Amerika’s “OK OK” texts, we played around with layout for concrete poetry.
