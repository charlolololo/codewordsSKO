     <p style="margin-top: -12px;">
        Coding has always been an area that I did my best to avoid, as I have always been weak in areas<br>
        related to technology. However, this year I made sure to choose studios heavily surrounding new<br>
        technology to challenge myself. Thus, I knew I had to choose this in Semester 2 when I saw the<br>
        introduction and website from Codewords 2020.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 24px;">
        What is creative coding?
    </h2>

    <p style="margin-top: -6px;">
        Initially, I had no idea what to expect as my only impression of creative coding came from the<br>
        Codewords 2020 website. I tried searching for examples on my own but did not even know what<br>
        kind of key words to use. The examples of creative coding given by Andy really helped to set a better<br>
        perspective of what exactly we could create with coding. While the whole concept still seems rather<br>
        abstract to me, I now have more ideas on what one can create through coding.<br><br>
        
        One of the creatives introduced that left an impression on me was Winnie Soon from Hong Kong.<br>
        As a Singaporean-Chinese, designs with Chinese characters often evoke a sense of nostalgia in me<br>
        as it reminds me of home. Upon a closer look, I realised that I had chanced upon her work last year in ACCA!

        Concrete Poetry
    </h2>
    
    

    <div class="element1">
        <p style="margin-top: -6px; width: 400px;">
            After exploring the basics of creative coding we were introduced to the idea of concrete poetry.
            With Mark Amerika's “OK OK” texts, we played around with layout for concrete poetry.
            <br><br>
            Afterwards, we were challenged to use a short phrase that we could use to construct our own
            concrete poetry. I have a friend who always likes to jokingly say, “Don't be sorry, be better,”
            whenever one of us in the friend group messes up. Hence, I chose to use the first half of the
            phrase for my concrete poetry experimentation.

        Introduction to HTML
    </h2>

    <p style="margin-top: -6px;">
        Before going straight into coding with HTML, we had to understand what exactly was WWW and the Anatomy of a Webpage.<br>
        In my previous jobs and internships when I had to work with areas such as SEO optimisation, I was heavily confused,<br>
        but learning what goes on behind every webpage now helps everything make sense.
        <br><br>
        After understanding the basics, we finally began to code in Visual Studio Code. Even the set-up of the application was<br>
        overwhelming, as I am not used to the large amount of texts compared to just looking at an Adobe Suite.
        <br><br>    
        While most of the information can already be found on the W3Schools website, here are some notes from what we learnt <br>
        that week which I felt would be helpful for myself:
    </p>

    <pre style="margin-top: 36px; width: 500px; margin-left: 36px;"><code>
    Some notes I took in class:
        - &lt;head&gt; where you put the seo
                &lt;title&gt;codeWords_2024&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;helloworld!&lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;
        - Space doesn't matter except for certain occasions
            - Doctype isn't that important
        - Anything in the body is in the browser window
        - Use Copilot for Visual Studio Code instead of ChatGPT
        - &lt;div&gt; is like a group → action applies to everything
        - &lt;em&gt;
        - &lt;strong&gt;
        - &lt;h1&gt;/&lt;h2&gt;/&lt;h3&gt;
        - &lt;vh&gt; &lt;vw&gt;
            - E.g. font size = 20vw
            - Numbers range in 100 or range in %
            </code></pre>

            <div>
                <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                The first thing we coded on Visual Studio Code was setting up a basic page; our very own “Hello World” page.We explored
                basic styling as well as the concept between divs, headers and body text. This section was rather overwhelming, as I was
                basically learning a whole new language. While this page looks old-fashioned, it contains a lot of important basic tags
                such as &lt;div&gt; and the various styling that I am still relatively new to. After setting up
                a basic page, we explored how to
                change elements on the page such as repeating the background, making it responsive as well as distorting text.
                <br><br>
                I was a little confused about file paths and when to separate different files into folders. From this file path,<br>
                I realised that I can place multiple HTML files into the same folder and they would still run.
