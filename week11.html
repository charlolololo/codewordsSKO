    <h1>Week 11</h1> 

    <h2 style="margin-top:-36px;">Working with Blender</h2>

    <p style="margin-right:36px;">
        After working on the main project for the past few weeks, I realised I had been neglecting my SKO progress for a while. Still moving forward with my initial plan to create a claw machine,<br>
         decided to try creating a collection of furry characters to represent each week's reflection. Following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr7UaL7tMMw&ab_channel=SouthernShotty " target="_blank">this Youtube video</a>, I first tried to model a mushroom, before using the hair curves on Blender to add fur to it. However, the curves slowed my laptop down tremendously, and I realised it might not be as feasible to include it into my website. Afterwards, I tried working around with removing the hair so that I could render it quicker, but I did not like the effect created. The only reason I chose to work with Blender was for the 3D aesthetics. However, if this was the effect that it created, I felt that it was more practical to just work with 2D designs instead. I also realised that the models would only need to be uploaded as PNG renders, as they would not need to turn in any direction. If all the models had to do was to be picked up by the claw, the only 3D object that I would liekly have to place as a 3D object would be the claw for the cursor.

        Changes to SKO
    </h2>

    <p>
    As I was getting ready to code up my claw machine, I quickly realised that I would need to include a lot of math if I wanted to animate the cursor as a claw. With my limited coding knowledge, it was not feasible to finish this within the span of this studio, especially if I planned to animate a 3D object. Thus, I decided to change my idea to be a simple website. Building on the idea of vintage phone aesthetics, I decided to work with similar pixelated designs for my final SKO, so that it would look cohesive with my final project as well. I might work on the claw machine idea in my own free time, but I know it might take me a few months for me to perfect it to the level that I initially proposed.
