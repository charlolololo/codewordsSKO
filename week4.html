    <h1>Week 4</h1> 

    <h2>Choice of Text</h2>
    
    <div class="element1">
    <p style="width:900px;">
        We were given time over the week to choose from one of the given texts, or find our own, that was related to digital media. I wanted to find one of my own text, as I felt that I would be able to create better designs if I connected with it emotionally.
        
        After some research, I landed on the book “Search History” by local Melburnian author, Amy Taylor. If one based entirely off the summary of the book, it would not really relate well to the theme of digital media, as it is mainly about a woman’s retroactive jealousy with her current boyfriend’s dead girlfriend. However, I found it interesting how her unhealthy habits were exacerbated by digital media, something I feel that many people can relate to, even if it might be different varieties of habits.

        I eventually landed on the sentence, “She paused and then deleted "<em>think</em>"" replacing it with "<em>feel</em>”. I was contemplating between this and another sentence in the book where the speaker was unhealthily comparing herself to her partner’s ex due to her incessant stalking. However, I felt that this sentence relates to a wider variety of audience, both male and female. In today’s age where texting is such a large part of everyone’s lives, everyone has come to place overtly fixed connotations on various words, leading to unnecessary stressing when texting others. So much meaning has been placed onto small aspects such as using a full stop or capital letters, leaving someone on delivered or replying immediately, that it pushes one to question; why has this become the new norm?
