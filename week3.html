    <h1>Week 3</h1>

    <p style="margin-top: -12px;">
        After working on on HTML and CSS for the past few weeks, we were introduced to Javascript,<br>
        mainly working with P5.js, to provide interactivity to our designs.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 24px;">
        Reading Machines
    </h2>

    <div class="element1">
    <p>
        In the first half of the session, we looked at a few examples of creative coding for concrete poetry for more inspiration.
        <br><br>
        From Angelo Plessas' body of works, we had to choose one work of his that we liked. 
        I chose <a href="https://www.everythinghappensasitshould.com" target="_blank">Everything Happens As It Should</a>.
        <br><br>
        I initially clicked into it because the title of the website was intriguing. The website's combination of animation, interactivity and<br>
        sound evoked some nostalgia in me, even though I did not understand the entire concept of this website. Due to the emotional<br>
        connection I felt with this design, I chose it as inspiration if I ever decided to create something similar.
        <br><br>
        Some other works shown in class that I was inspired by includes Yoko Ono's “Painting to Enlarge and See”, the Reading Machines<br>
        website as well as Age of Earthquakes by Douglas Coupland.

        Machine Instructions
    </h2>
    
    <div class="element1">
    <div>
    <p>
        Coding is keying in specific instructions for a machine that has no prior knowledge other than what is already given to it.<br>
        Thus, to show this in practice as well as teach us to be specific in our instructions, we had a machine instructions practice.<br>
        Each of us drew out a simple image, wrote out instructions on how to recreate said image, and passed the instructions to<br>
        someone else for them to figure out the drawing only with text-based instructions. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>My instructions for a matcha bowl and whisk:</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Draw a rectangle vertically</li>
        <li>Draw lines out from the bottom of the rectangle in the shape of a triangle</li>
        <li>Draw an oval around the bottom half of the lines</li>
        <li>Draw a curve that connects one end of the oval to the other from the bottom</li>
        <li>Colour in the bottom of the lines</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>I exchanged my instructions with Peran's:</p>
        <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Draw 2 circles, the same size, that are horizontally separated by 2 circle distance</li>
                <li>Draw a rectangle thats bottom aligns with the middle of the two circles and overlaps.<br>
                    The width of the rectangle is slightly wider than the distance between the 2 circles</li>
                <li>Complete the drawing by drawing a smaller rectangle that aligns with the right of the big rectangle.<br>
                    Half the height of the big rectangle.</li>
            </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        We were supposed to follow the instructions exactly, instead of trying to figure out it out using our own guesses.<br>
        However, as humans, both Peran and I did try to guess what the other party was trying to give instructions on.<br>
        His instructions were so much more detailed than mine, and I could recreate his design exactly even without<br>
        trying to guess what it was, as seen in the image. On the other hand, he had a hard time with mine, and even<br>
        assuming it was a pen with a cup. This exercise was helpful in showing me that I had to be more specific in<br>
        my instructions. I assumed that my instructions were clear enough, but it was only due to the bias I had in<br>
        my head, knowing what I wanted to draw. If it is already so difficult for a human to recreate my instructions,<br>
        what more can I expect from a machine?

        Introduction to p5.js
    </h2>

    <pre style="margin-left: 36px; margin-right: 36px;"><code>
    Some class notes regarding p5.js
        - z height = arrangement/layering
        - command / > stops the the line in processing for you
        - pmouse x & pmouse y = previous mouse x & y
        - everything is done in order
        - z-axis happens in the order that you write the lines of code
    </code></pre>

    <p style="margin-top: 36px">
        Before today's class, I was still rather confused on why we needed to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript just to make<br>
        one website. Today, I learnt that JS is for interactivity, and HTML for overall styling. I think I will understand it better<br>
        as I code up my final project, but right now I have not seen much use for HTML as it feels as though we can create<br>
        anything using the p5.JS library.

    <p style="margin-top: 36px;">
        This is the final code from today's class that I ended up with.  It was overwhelming to learn an entirely new language at<br>
        such a fast pace, but one thing I realised from p5.js is how much more straightforward the instructions are compared to<br>
        HTML and CSS. While HTML and CSS had many new terms, p5.js is easier as their terms are similar to Adobe, such as<br>
        strokeWeight, line and createCanvas.
        <br><br>
        My main challenge when it came to p5.js would be the idea of frame rates. As someone who finds animation difficult,<br>
        it is hard to wrap my head around the idea of frame rates. As we worked with varying the number of frame rates and<br>
        depending on where we used it, it help me to better understand what exactly it did. I went through quite a few trials<br>
        and errors before getting the frame rate that I felt best suited my design.

                frameRate(5);

        Making a Face
    </h2>

    <div class="element1">
    <div>
    <p>
        We were tasked to create a self-portrait of ourselves using simple shapes for homework this week. As someone with a background<br>
        in fine arts during high school, simplifying complicated images is difficult for me. Shading and providing natural details has always<br>
        come more naturally to me than creating cartoon-like images. Even when transitioning into this degree, it was hard to understand<br>
        vectors and shapes. Thus, this piece of homework was quite difficult.
        <br><br>
        We tried an activity similar to the machine instructions for our self-portrait. We hand-drew what our design might look like when<br>
        converted to pixels. Of course, it ended up looking slightly different when I tried to recreate it on Processing. However, I still<br>
        felt like it provided a good gauge of where to place the facial features, compared to if I had done it without a sketch.
        <br><br>
        There was not much information online on how to code a face, and if there was, I didn't feel that it suited my design aesthetics. <br>
        Finally, I managed to find a designer's works that I liked. She made use of unique simple shapes that I would not have otherwise<br>
        thought of, such as diamonds for the eyes and large blocks of solid colours to frame the character's hair. While it seems rather<br>
        simple upon first glance, after understanding how much goes on when doing this from scratch with JS, I thought her code would<br>
        be good to reference for my work.
